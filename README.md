## 📝 Description

This project represents a front-end task implementation focused on working with dynamic data, rendering UI elements, and handling user interactions in the browser.  
It uses a simple build setup and mock data to simulate a real-world front-end workflow.

The goal of the project was to practice structuring a front-end application, separating source and build files, and working with JavaScript logic beyond simple static pages.
